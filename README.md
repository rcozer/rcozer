- 👋 Hi, I’m @rcozer
- 👀 I’m interested in getting back into programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently starting my journey to learn to build my own NAS.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on TrueNAS (FreeNAS), OpenMediaVault and perhaps XigmaNas. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... Well I will have to remember to update my README.md file later when I'm setup and ready to collaborate.
